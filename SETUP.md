## Running tests

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ python hello_world_test.py
```

(Replace `hello_world_test.py` with the name of the test file.)


### Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `exercism/python/<exerciseName>` directory.

For example, if you're submitting `hello_world.py` for the *Hello, World!* exercise, the submit command would be something like `exercism submit <path_to_exercism_dir>/python/hello-world/hello_world.py`.
