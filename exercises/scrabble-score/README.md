# Scrabble Score

Given a word, compute the scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```text
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples

"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions

- You can play a double or a triple letter.
- You can play a double or a triple word.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you shold write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the appropriate command below:

| Python Version | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 2.7 | `py.test scrabble_score_test.py` |
| 3.3+ | `pytest scrabble_score_test.py` |
| 2.7, 3.3+ | `python -m pytest scrabble_score_test.py` |

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><strong>Common pytest options</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-v</td>
        <td>enable verbose output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-x</td>
        <td>stop running tests on first failure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--ff</td>
        <td>run failures from previous test before running other tests</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/scrabble-score` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.
