# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you shold write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the appropriate command below:

| Python Version | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 2.7 | `py.test isogram_test.py` |
| 3.3+ | `pytest isogram_test.py` |
| 2.7, 3.3+ | `python -m pytest isogram_test.py` |

    <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><strong>Common pytest options</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-v</td>
        <td>enable verbose output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-x</td>
        <td>stop running tests on first failure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--ff</td>
        <td>run failures from previous test before running other tests</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`
