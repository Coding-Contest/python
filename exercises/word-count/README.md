# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you shold write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, run the appropriate command below:

| Python Version | Command |
| --- | --- |
| 2.7 | `py.test word_count_test.py` |
| 3.3+ | `pytest word_count_test.py` |
| 2.7, 3.3+ | `python -m pytest word_count_test.py` |

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="2"><strong>Common pytest options</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-v</td>
        <td>enable verbose output</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-x</td>
        <td>stop running tests on first failure</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>--ff</td>
        <td>run failures from previous test before running other tests</td>
    </tr>
</table>

For other options, see `python -m pytest -h`

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/word-count` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).

## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
