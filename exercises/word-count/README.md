# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each word in that phrase.

For example for the input `"olly olly in come free"`

```text
olly: 2
in: 1
come: 1
free: 1
```

## Exception messages

Sometimes it is necessary to raise an exception. When you do this, you should include a meaningful error message to
indicate what the source of the error is. This makes your code more readable and helps significantly with debugging. Not
every exercise will require you to raise an exception, but for those that do, the tests will only pass if you include
a message.

To raise a message with an exception, just write it as an argument to the exception type. For example, instead of
`raise Exception`, you shold write:

```python
raise Exception("Meaningful message indicating the source of the error")
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests run the command `python -m pytest word_count_test.py`
(`py.test word_count_test.py` for Python 2; `pytest <exercise>_test.py` for Python 3). Or run it with
`-v` to be more verbose like this: `pytest word_count_test.py`. Using the
`-x` flag will cause the test to fail at the first failure instead of it
trying all cases before exiting.

To run this exercises's tests for example, run this command:
```
python -m pytest word_count_test.py -v
```

## Submitting Exercises

Note that, when trying to submit an exercise, make sure the solution is in the `$EXERCISM_WORKSPACE/python/word-count` directory.

You can find your Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line that starts with `Workspace`.

For more detailed information about running tests, code style and linting,
please see the [help page](http://exercism.io/languages/python).

## Source

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
