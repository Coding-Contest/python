# Instructions append

Create a `SpaceAge` class that includes methods for _all_ planets, following the naming convention `on_<planet>`.

Each method should take no arguments and return the age in years, rounded to two decimal places. The age is based on the number of seconds passed in the constructor when the instance was created.

For example, calling `SpaceAge(1000000000).on_earth()` should return `31.69` to indicate the age of one billion seconds on Earth in years.
