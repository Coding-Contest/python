# Introduction

You've decided to make your video game manufacturing company The CatnessÂ® fully remote: all employees work from home!
This has multiple advantages: after all, transit is annoying and exhausting, and everyone has their commute time back for more important activities (_like plying on their gaming consoles_).
Furthermore, people all over the world have heard about your wonderful company, and you've got lots of new and diverse talent working away at the latest edition of your flagship game _**Mad Cat**_. 

You're thrilled! 
There's only one hitch. 
To ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and keeping to the release schedule, you need to have a weekly meeting.
It's tough to arrange a meeting across different timezones, and your first attempt was a ghastly failure.
Many crucial people spent time rubbing their eyes and not paying attention.
Worse, there were a lot of absences because employees miscalculated their local meeting start times. 

Your advisor tells you to calculate a timing suitable for everybody _and_ email employees with their local timings - but you barely passed high school math. 
You panic as the date of release looms: but you've realized that you can write a program to do it for you!
