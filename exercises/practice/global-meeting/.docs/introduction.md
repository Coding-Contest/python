# Introduction

You've decided to make your video game manufacturing company fully remote: all employees work from home!
This has multiple advantages: after all, transit is annoying, and you have much more time to play on your video console (working for the company, of course).
Sun or rain, no matter to you anymore. 
Furthermore, people all over the world have heard about your wonderful company, and you've got lots of new and diverse talent working away at the latest edition of _Mad Cat_. 

You're thrilled! 
There's only one hitch. 
To ensure that everyone is working towards the same product and brainstorm your next bestseller, you need to have a weekly meeting. 
Unfortunately, it's tough to arrange a meeting with people from different timezones, and your first attempt was a ghastly failure where many crucial people spent time rubbing their eyes.

Your advisor tells you to calculate a timing suitable for everybody - but you barely passed high school math. 
You panic as the date of release looms: but you've realized that you can write a program to do it for you!
