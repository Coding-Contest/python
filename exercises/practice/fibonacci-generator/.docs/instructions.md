# Instructions

Creat a generator that on every iteration will return the next element of the
[Fibonacci series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) that you
will be able to use in the following code:

```
for num in fibo():
    print(num)
    if num > 1000:
        break
```

## Note

The series starts with 0:

0, 1, 1, 2, ...
