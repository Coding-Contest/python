Wheat and chessboard. 

Once a king, who loved chess, challenged his servant to solve a puzzle and get a bag of gold if servant guesses correctly.

If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?

Chessboard has 64 squares in total.

Write code that shows:
- how many grains there are on a given square, and
- the total number of grains on the chessboard at the end
