# Design

## Goal

This concept exercise is meant to teach an understanding/creation/use of `lambda` or `anonymous functions` in python. 

## Learning objectives

- Understand what an `anonymous function` is, and how to create one
  - The syntax of creating a `lambda` 
  - Using different `function argument` flavors with `lambda`
- Understand the differences between `lambdas` and Pythons "regular" `functions`
- Understand what problems are solved by using a `lambda`
- The pitfalls of `lambdas`, and when to avoid them
- Using `lambdas` as `key functions` in other situations such as `sort()` , `sorted()`, `min()`, and `max()`
- Applying arguments to a `lambda` via IIFE (_immediately invoked function expression_)
- Anti-patterns when using `lambdas` 
 
## Out of scope

- `comprehensions`
- `comprehensions` in `lambdas`
- using a `decorator` on a `lambda`
- `functools` (_this will get its own exercise_)
- `generators`
- `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` (_these will get their own exercise_)
- using an `assignment expression` or "walrus" operator (`:=`) in a `lambda`

## Concepts

- `anonymous-functions`
- `lambdas`
- `functions`
- `higher-order functions`
- `functions as arguments`
- `functions as returns`
- `nested funcitons`
