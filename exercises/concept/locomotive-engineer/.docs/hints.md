# Hints

## General

## 1. Create a list of all wagons

- Multiple arguments in a function can be packed with the `*` operator.

## 2. Fix list of wagons

- Using unpacking with the `*` operator, lets you extract the first two elements of a list while keeping the rest intact.
- To add another list into an existing list, you can use the `*` operator to "spread" the list.

## 3. Add missing stops

## 4. Extend routing information

## 5. Fix the wagon depot

- Using `zip(*iterators)` can use used to transpose a nested list.
- To extract data from the ziped iterators, you can use a for loop.
