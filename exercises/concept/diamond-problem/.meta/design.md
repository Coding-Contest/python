# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how inheritance works in Python OOP (Objec Oriented Programing), and how to make use of it.

## Learning objectives

- Know what `inheritance` on `OOP` is.
- Know how to make use of `inheritance` between classes in Python.
- Know the different types of `inheritance`.

## Out of scope

- Decorators.
- Dunder/magic method overriding.
- Data structures.
- Class-composition as an explicit topic.
- Dataclasses.
- Decorators.
- Generators.
- Coroutines.
- Descriptors.
- Using a class as a decorator.
- Performance considerations.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `intermediate`: Class inheritance.
- `intermediate`: MRO (Method Resolution Order).
- `intermediate`: Private attributes.
- `intermediate`: single inheritance.
- `intermediate`: multiple inheritance.
- `intermediate`: Mix-ins.
- `intermediate`: Built-in ***super()*** funcion.

## Prerequisites

Know what [classes][classes] are and the basiscs of how they work. In case you wonder what do I mean by [classes][classes], have a look to this concept first.
