# Instructions

Conda airlines has over 10.000 flights a day, but they need to automate. They are currently assigning all seats to passengers by hand.

They have asked _you_ to create software to automate the assigning of seats to passengers. They require your software to be memory efficient and performant.

Conda's airplanes have up to _6 seats_ in each row and can have many more rows.

While the rows are defined using numbers, seats in each row are defined using letters from the alphabet, with `seat A` being `seat 1` in its row.

You can use this _table_ as a guide:

| x             | 1         | 2     |
| :----:        | :----:    | :----:|
| Row           | 5         | 21    |
| Seat number   | 1         | 4     |
| Seat letter   | A         | D     |
| Result        | 5A        | 21D   |
