### Python and Object Oriented Programming (OOP)



High Scores requires that you make a **class** in Python, so you need to be familiar with the basics of  **Object Oriented Programming**.  _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think it is!_   Here are some tutorials and links to get you up to speed:



1)   [**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3**](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) from the Real Python website.  Goes over all the definitions and mechanics step by step.  Great for the absolute first-timer.



2) [**Object-Oriented Programming in Python 3**](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/object-oriented-programming-in-python-3)  from Lisa Tagliaferri on the DigitalOcean community blog.  This is more CS-language focused and covers both the introduction of classes and CS "theory" subjects like inheritance and polymorphism.  Good for those who are coming to Python from another OOP language, or those who are "intermediate" level.



3)  [**A First Look at Classes**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes) from the Python 3 documentation.  This is very well written and was compiled by the core maintainers of the Python programming language.  It's very focused on how classes and methods execute "under the covers" and how the namespaces for classes are created and resolved.  Good for those who are comfortable with reading technical documentation, talking about OOP, and looking at programming language internals.
