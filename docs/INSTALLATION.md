If Python isn't already available on your system follow the instructions at [the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/#getting-started) to install Python on your computer.

If you intend to use Python for scientific computing or data analytics, consider instead installing the [Anaconda or Miniconda versions](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), in which additional relevant packages have been bundled in the installation.

Exercism currently supports Python3.4, Python3.3 and Python2.7.


## Packages

The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) contains thousands of packages.
Pretty much each of them is installable with `pip install packagename`.
If you don't have __pip__ already, [get it now](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)!
