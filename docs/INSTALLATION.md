## Installing Python

If Python isn't already available on your system follow the instructions at [the Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/) to install Python on your computer.

Exercism currently supports Python2.7 and Python 3.3+.

## Packages

The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) contains thousands of packages.
Most of them are installable with `pip install packagename`.
