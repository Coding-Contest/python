Python is a powerful programming language which is easy to learn. It is multi platform and runs everywhere. It is licensed as open source. One of the coolest things about Python is the community: it helpful, friendly and collaborative.

Python is a strong language for beginners. There are many resources available for programmers of all levels, the code is highly readable, and in many cases phrases are comparable to those in the English language. Code can be written and executed from the command line, in an interactive IPython session, or in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) (IPython) notebook.

The most common form of Python is compiled in C. This is often invisible to the beginning programmer, but if there are uses for which exceptionally fast implementation is needed then C extensions can be written to optimize Python execution.

Python was started by Guido van Rossum in 1989. Its name is an homage to the comedy troupe Monty Python. Python 2 is used widely but support may end by 2020. Python 3 was introduced in 2008 and is beginning to be adopted more widely. They are similar, but users will encounter [some differences](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/python-2-vs-python-3). Python development is shepherded by [The Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/about/) and there are active community-based user groups worldwide.

### What python is good for?

[Python is used extensively](https://www.python.org/about/apps/) in scientific computing, finance, games, networking, internet development, and in assembling pipelines of other programs.

Python can be applied to many different classes of problems [what python is good for](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python-good-for). It have a powerful standard library with string processing, Internet protocols, software engineering, operating system interfaces. Python also have a lot of third-party modules, easily found in The Python Package Index (PyPi). Python software covers areas such as:

- [Web and Internet Development](https://www.python.org/about/apps/#web-and-internet-development)
- [Database Access](https://www.python.org/about/apps/#database-access)
- [Desktop GUIs](https://www.python.org/about/apps/#desktop-guis)
- [Scientific & Numeric](https://www.python.org/about/apps/#scientific-and-numeric)
- [Education](https://www.python.org/about/apps/#education)

### Reasons to learn

Some reasons to learn Python [Reasons to learn](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/reasons-to-learn-python):

- It is easy to learn. Python was designed to help the developer not the machine.
- It helps the novice programmer. Concepts used in python can be applied to other programming languages.
- It is fun. Some projects like [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs#introWhatIs) uses Python as the main language and can be used to create robots, remote controlled cars and video game consoles.

There are many job opportunities for Python developers in companies like Google, Yahoo!, Disney, Nokia, and IBM. Not to mention a huge amount of startups. It have a wide range of open source web application frameworks.
