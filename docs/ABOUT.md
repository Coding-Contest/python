Python is a powerful programming language, it is well known as a "glue" that means: it is used with many other technologies. It is multi platform, runs everywhere. Is friendly and easy to learn. It is licensed as open source, most versions are compatible with the GPL with a few exceptions on old versions. But, one of the most cool things about Python is the community that is very helpful and collaborative. Take a look at: [About python](https://www.python.org/about/).



### What python is good for?

Python can be applied to many different classes of problems [what python is good for](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/general.html#what-is-python-good-for). It have a powerful standard library with string processing, Internet protocols, software engineering, operating system interfaces. Python also have a lot of third-party modules, easily found in The Python Package Index (PyPi). Python software covers areas such as:
